# Juliet Calculator

A simple, small calculator written in Python

# About

Juliet is a small calculator written in Python. But not like many others, Juliet doesn't require you to enter first number or second number. Instead, it uses Regex, so you don't need to type first number, second number, operator like this:

```py
Enter first number: 2
Enter second number: 3
Enter operator: +
5
```

Just type the following:

```py
#2 + 3
5
```

And Juliet will calculate for you! :D
